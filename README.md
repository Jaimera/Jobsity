### Requirements
Docker

- If it is a new docker machine on windows you may need to change "experimental" to true on Docker Engine Settings.

### Running
Open main folder and use: 
```docker-compose up -d --build``` 

Open a browser and navigate to:
```http://localhost:8000```

Create a new user with a username and password, then you will be able to use the chat.

Enjoy!
